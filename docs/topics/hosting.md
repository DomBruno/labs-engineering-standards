## (HT-100) Permitted Hosting Providers

The following hosting providers are permitted for hosting application software:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Heroku

All other hosting providers are prohibited, including:

* Firebase
* Google Cloud Platform
* Zeit
* Netlify

Rationale:

* We restrict hosting choices in Lambda Labs so that we can focus our resources on a subset of available providers. By narrowing the field of choices, we feel that product quality will be improved through the sharing of common knowledge and reusable components.

Exceptions:

* None
