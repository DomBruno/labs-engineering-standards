## (AA-100) Approved API Architectures
Only the following API Architectures are approved for projects in Labs:

Engine
------------ | 
REST         |
GraphQL      | 

Rationale:

- We restrict the API architecture usage in Lambda Labs so that we can focus our resources on a subset of available technologies. By narrowing the field of choices, we feel that product quality will be improved through the sharing of common knowledge and reusable components.

These two architectures cover the vast majority of use cases, enjoy significant market share, and are not mutually exclusive.

Exceptions:

- None
