# Code Quality

## (CQ-100) High Maintainability

All repositories *must* maintain their `master` branch at a Code Climate maintainability score of C or above. This score *must* be updated at least once per day, ideally whenever code is merged into the `master` branch. The score must be displayed on the README at the root of the repository.

Rationale:

- Code Climate provides a robust and industry standard measure for the maintainability of a code base. While this is only one of many possible measures, Code Climate provides a solid baseline for measuring code quality.

Exceptions:

- Programming languages not supported by Code Climate.

## (CQ-200) Robust Test Coverage

All repositories are required to maintain a test code coverage level of 30% and above for their `master` branch. Code coverage percentage *must* be updated at least once per day, ideally whenever code is merged into the `master` branch. The coverage percentage must be displayed on the README at the root of the repository.

Rationale:

- Code coverage is an indicator of how well test cases cover the codebase. While not a singular indicator of test quality, it is an important factor in ensuring that test cases cover a wide area of the codebase.

Exceptions:

- None
